# Contributing to GSD-2

We're glad you're here. GSD-2 is an open project and contributions are welcome across the entire codebase. We hold a high bar for what gets merged — not to be gatekeepers, but because every change ships to real users and stability matters.

Read [VISION.md](VISION.md) before contributing. It defines what GSD-2 is, what it isn't, and what we won't accept.

## Before you start

1. **Check existing issues.** Someone may already be working on it.
2. **Claim the issue.** Comment on the issue to get it assigned to you before writing code. This prevents duplicate work and wasted effort.
3. **No issue? Create one first** for new features. Bug fixes for obvious problems can skip this step.
4. **Architectural changes require an RFC.** If your change touches core systems (auto-mode, agent-core, orchestration), open an issue describing your approach and get approval before writing code. We use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant decisions.

### First-time contributors

We are not a fan of drive-by first-time contributions. If this is your first PR to GSD-2, you **must** open an issue first describing the problem or feature, wait for a maintainer response, and link the issue in your PR. First-time PRs that show up with no prior issue will be closed without review. This is not optional — it exists because triaging unsolicited code from unknown contributors is more expensive than the contribution is worth.

Once you have one merged PR, this requirement no longer applies to you.

## Local development

### One-time setup (after cloning)

```bash
npm ci                              # Install dependencies — MUST run first
npm run secret-scan:install-hook    # Install git hooks — run once
```

`npm ci` creates workspace symlinks in `node_modules/@gsd/*` and `node_modules/@gsd-build/*` pointing to `packages/`. These are required for builds and tests to resolve packages correctly.

Run `npm run secret-scan:install-hook` once after cloning. It installs a pre-commit hook that blocks commits containing hardcoded secrets or credentials. Conventional Commits format is validated by CI on push.

### Day-to-day development

```bash
npm run build    # Build
npm test         # Run tests
```

If `npm run build` fails after running tests (e.g. `Cannot find module '@gsd/*'` errors), run `npm ci` first to restore workspace symlinks, then try again.

### Before pushing

```bash
npm run verify:pr    # Local preflight: build:core → typecheck:extensions → test:unit
```

If `verify:pr` fails after running tests (e.g. `Cannot find module '@gsd/*'` errors), run `npm ci` first to restore workspace symlinks, then try again.

### Cross-platform note

GSD-2 runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows:

- **Git hooks** are executed by Git's bundled shell, so they work from any terminal (CMD, PowerShell, Git Bash).
- **Shell scripts** in `scripts/` use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. On Windows, Git may convert these to CRLF line endings, which breaks the shebang. If you hit shebang errors when running lint scripts locally, create a `.gitattributes` file in the repo root with `*.sh text eol=lf` to force LF checkout. Do not commit this file.

## Branching and commits

Always work on a dedicated branch. Never push directly to `main`.

**Branch naming:** `<type>/<short-description>`

| Type        | When to use                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New functionality                      |
| `fix/`      | Bug or defect correction               |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `test/`     | Adding or updating tests               |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only                     |
| `chore/`    | Dependencies, tooling, housekeeping    |
| `ci/`       | CI/CD configuration                    |

**Commit messages** must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The commit-msg hook enforces this locally; CI enforces it on push.

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

Valid types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `chore` `refactor` `test` `infra` `ci` `perf` `build` `revert`

```
feat(pi-agent-core): add streaming output for long-running tasks
fix(pi-ai): resolve null pointer on empty provider response
chore(deps): bump typescript from 5.3.0 to 5.4.2
```

Keep branches current by rebasing onto `main` — do not merge `main` into your feature branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

CI must pass before your PR will be reviewed. Run `npm run verify:pr` locally before pushing to catch issues early.

## Working with GSD (team workflow)

GSD uses worktree-based isolation for multi-developer work. If you're contributing with GSD running, enable team mode in your project preferences:

```yaml
# .gsd/PREFERENCES.md
---
version: 1
mode: team
---
```

This enables unique milestone IDs, branch pushing, and pre-merge checks — preventing milestone ID collisions when multiple contributors run auto-mode simultaneously. Each developer gets their own isolated worktree; squash merges to `main` happen independently.

For full details see [docs/working-in-teams.md](docs/working-in-teams.md) and [docs/git-strategy.md](docs/git-strategy.md).

## Opening a pull request

### PR description format

Every PR needs a **TL;DR** and a **detailed explanation**. Use this structure:

```
## TL;DR

**What:** One sentence — what does this change?
**Why:** One sentence — why is it needed?
**How:** One sentence — what's the approach?

## What

Detailed description of the change. What files, modules, or systems are affected?

## Why

The motivation. What problem does this solve? What was broken, missing, or suboptimal?
Link issues where applicable: `Closes #123`

## How

The approach. How does the implementation work? What were the key decisions?
If this is a non-trivial change, explain the design and any alternatives you considered.
```

### Requirements

- **CI must pass.** If your PR breaks tests, fix them before requesting review.
- **Run `npm run verify:pr` locally before pushing.** See [Local development](#local-development) for setup.
- **One concern per PR.** A bug fix is a bug fix. A feature is a feature. Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- **No drive-by formatting.** Don't reformat code you didn't change. Don't reorder imports in files you're not modifying.
- **Link issues when relevant.** Not mandatory for every PR, but if an issue exists, reference it.

### Change type checklist

Include in your PR:

- [ ] `feat` — New feature or capability
- [ ] `fix` — Bug fix
- [ ] `refactor` — Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` — Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `docs` — Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` — Build, CI, or tooling changes

### Breaking changes

If your PR changes any public API, CLI behavior, config format, or file structure, say so explicitly. Breaking changes need extra scrutiny and may need migration guidance.

## AI-assisted contributions

AI-generated PRs are first-class citizens here. We welcome them. We just ask for transparency:

- **Disclose it.** Note that the PR is AI-assisted in your description. Do not credit the AI tool as an author or co-author in the commit or PR.
- **Test it.** AI-generated code must be tested to the same standard as human-written code. "The AI said it works" is not a test plan.
- **Understand it.** You should be able to explain what the code does and why. If a reviewer asks a question, "I'll ask the AI" is not an answer.

AI agents opening PRs must follow the same workflow as human contributors: clean working tree, new branch per task, CI passing before requesting review. Multi-phase work should start as a Draft PR and only move to Ready when complete.

AI PRs go through the same review process as any other PR. No special treatment in either direction.

## Architecture guidelines

Before writing code, understand these principles:

- **Extension-first.** Can this be an extension instead of a core change? If yes, build it as an extension.
- **Simplicity wins.** Don't add abstractions, helpers, or utilities for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements.
- **Tests are the contract.** Changed behavior? The test suite tells you what you broke.

See [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the full list of what we won't accept.

## Extension contributions

GSD is extension-first. If your feature can be an extension, build it as an extension. See [docs/extension-sdk/](docs/extension-sdk/) for the authoritative guide.

### Extension tiers

| Tier | Ships with GSD | Can be disabled | Review bar |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **core** | Yes | No | RFC required. Reserved for foundational systems (GSD workflow, built-in tools). |
| **bundled** | Yes | Yes | Standard PR review. Default for new features shipped with GSD. |
| **community** | No | Yes | User-installed. No review needed — lives in `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/` or `.gsd/extensions/`. |

### Required for bundled extension PRs

1. **`extension-manifest.json`** — every extension directory must include one. See [Manifest Spec](docs/extension-sdk/manifest-spec.md).
2. **Tests** — at minimum, test tool registration, command handling, and any event hooks. See [Testing](docs/extension-sdk/testing.md).
3. **State reconstruction** — if your extension has stateful tools, handle `session_start`, `session_switch`, and `session_tree` events. See [Building Extensions](docs/extension-sdk/building-extensions.md#state-management).
4. **`provides` must be accurate** — every tool, command, hook, and shortcut your extension registers must be listed in the manifest.
5. **Use `@gsd/pi-coding-agent`** for types, `@sinclair/typebox` for schemas, `@gsd/pi-tui` for UI. Do not import from `@mariozechner/*` (legacy).

### Promoting community → bundled

If you've built a community extension that should ship with GSD:

1. Open an issue describing the extension and why it should be bundled.
2. Move the source into `src/resources/extensions/<name>/`.
3. Change the tier to `"bundled"` in the manifest.
4. Add tests meeting the standards above.
5. Open a PR following the normal process.

## Scope areas

The codebase is organized into these areas. All are open to contributions:

| Area              | Path                            | Notes                                          |

## Review process

PRs go through automated review first, then human review. To help us review efficiently:

- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized. Massive PRs take longer to review and are more likely to be sent back.
- Respond to review comments. If you disagree, explain why — discussion is welcome.
- If your PR has been open for a while without review, ping in Discord. We're a small team and things slip.

### Stale or unreviewable PRs

Keep open PRs in a reviewable, merge-ready state. For PR authors below maintainer level, PRs that remain blocked by failing CI, merge conflicts, or requested follow-up for more than 3 days may be closed without merge. Prior contributor status is not an exemption; the exemption is maintainer-level repository access.

If your PR is closed for staleness, you are welcome to resubmit when you are ready to bring it back in an issue-free, reviewable state. Closing stale PRs is queue management, not a rejection of future work on the same idea.

Maintainer-level PRs are not auto-closed under this policy, but they may receive a reminder comment asking the author to finish the PR or close it if it is no longer moving.

### 72-hour response policy

Once a maintainer leaves review feedback, you have **72 hours** to respond — either with a code update, a question, or a comment explaining your timeline. We reserve the right to close PRs that go silent past 72 hours. Closed PRs can be reopened once you're ready to engage; we're not trying to throw away your work, we're trying to keep the review queue honest about what's actually moving.

If you know you'll be unavailable, say so in the PR — a one-line "out until Monday" is enough to pause the clock.

### What reviewers verify

Reading a diff is not the same as verifying a change. Our review standard is execution-based, not static-analysis-based.

**What reviewers do:**

1. **Check out the branch** — check out the PR branch locally (or in a worktree). Don't review from the diff view alone.
2. **Build the branch** — run `npm run build`. A diff that doesn't compile is not reviewable.
3. **Run the test suite** — run `npm test`. CI status is a signal, not a substitute for local verification.
4. **Trace root cause for bug fixes** — confirm the diff addresses the root cause described in the issue, not just the symptom.
5. **Check for a regression test** — bug fixes must include a test that would have caught the original bug. If it's absent, the fix is incomplete.
6. **Reject source-grep tests** — any test that reads a source file with `readFileSync` (or equivalent) and asserts via regex/string match/AST inspection is not a test. Send it back. See "No source-grep tests" under Testing standards.

Only after completing these steps should a reviewer make claims about correctness.

**What "looks right" means:**

"Looks right" is the starting point for review, not the conclusion. "The tests pass" only means the tests pass — not that the claimed bug is fixed or the feature works as described. A well-written commit message on a broken change is still a broken change.

### What contributors must provide to unblock review

- **Bug fixes** — include a regression test. A fix without a test is an assertion, not a proof.
- **Features** — include tests covering the primary success path and at least one failure path.
- **Behavior changes** — update or replace any existing tests that cover the changed behavior. Don't leave passing-but-wrong tests in place.

If your PR claims to fix issue #N, reviewers will verify the fix addresses the root cause described in #N — not just that CI is green.

## Testing standards

This project uses Node.js built-in `node:test` as the test runner. All new tests must follow these patterns:

### Use `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`

```typescript
import { describe, test, beforeEach, afterEach } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
```

Do not use `createTestContext()` from `test-helpers.ts` (legacy, being removed). Do not introduce Jest, Vitest, or other test frameworks.

### Use `beforeEach`/`afterEach` or `t.after()` for cleanup — never `try`/`finally`

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT — shared fixture with beforeEach/afterEach
describe("feature", () => {
  let tmp: string;
  beforeEach(() => {
    tmp = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), "test-"));
  });
  afterEach(() => {
    rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true });
  });

  test("case", () => {
    /* clean test body */
  });
});

// ✅ CORRECT — per-test cleanup with t.after()
test("case", (t) => {
  const tmp = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), "test-"));
  t.after(() => {
    rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true });
  });
  // test body
});

// ❌ WRONG — inline try/finally
test("case", () => {
  const tmp = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), "test-"));
  try {
    // test body
  } finally {
    rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true });
  }
});
```

**When to use which:**

- `beforeEach`/`afterEach` — when all tests in a `describe` block share the same setup/teardown pattern
- `t.after()` — when each test has unique cleanup (different fixtures, env vars, etc.)
- `try`/`finally` — only inside standalone helper functions that don't have access to the test context `t` (e.g., `withEnv()`, `capture()`)

### Template literal fixture data

When constructing multi-line fixture content (markdown, YAML, etc.) inside indented test blocks, use array join to avoid unintended leading whitespace:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT — no indentation leakage
const content = [
  "## Slices",
  "- [x] **S01: First slice**",
  "- [ ] **S02: Second slice**",
].join("\n");

// ❌ WRONG — template literal inside describe/test adds leading spaces
const content = `
  ## Slices
  - [x] **S01: First slice**
`;
// Each line now has 2 leading spaces, breaking ^## regex anchors
```

### Test-first for bug fixes

Bug fixes must include a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after. Write the test first, confirm it fails, then apply the fix. See the `test-first-bugfix` skill.

### No source-grep tests

A test must execute the code under test. Reading a source file with `readFileSync` (or any equivalent) and asserting against its contents with regex, string matching, or AST inspection is **not a test** — it asserts that the code was *written a certain way*, not that it *behaves correctly*. This is pure Goodhart's Law: the metric (test count, coverage) gets satisfied while the actual property (correctness) is untouched.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — source-grep test. Passes if the string exists, regardless of behavior.
test("handles null input", () => {
  const source = readFileSync("src/parser.ts", "utf8");
  assert.match(source, /if \(input === null\)/);
});

// ❌ WRONG — same anti-pattern with AST or string includes.
test("exports the function", () => {
  const source = readFileSync("src/index.ts", "utf8");
  assert.ok(source.includes("export function parse"));
});

// ✅ CORRECT — import the code and exercise it.
import { parse } from "../src/parser.ts";
test("handles null input", () => {
  assert.equal(parse(null), undefined);
});
```

PRs containing source-grep tests will be sent back. CI enforces this via `scripts/check-source-grep-tests.sh` (wired into the `lint` job) — it scans changed test files for `readFileSync` / `readFile` calls whose path argument points into `src/` or `packages/`. If the code under test is genuinely hard to invoke (e.g., a build script, a CLI entry point), invoke it as a subprocess and assert on its real output — not on its source text.

The narrow exception: tests that legitimately verify *file structure* as the actual product (e.g., a code generator's output, a config-file linter, a script that produces a manifest). In those cases the file contents *are* the behavior. Opt out with a same-line or preceding-line marker:

```typescript
// allow-source-grep: this test verifies the codegen output, which IS the product
const generated = readFileSync("packages/codegen/dist/manifest.ts", "utf8");
assert.match(generated, /export const ROUTES =/);
```

The reason becomes part of the diff and is visible at review. If you're not sure whether your case qualifies, it doesn't.

### Three recurring defect classes (CodeRabbit themes)

CI enforces three specific patterns that have caused real bugs in merged PRs (see issue #4931). All three are checked by `scripts/check-coderabbit-themes.mjs`.

**1. `Statement#get()` returns `undefined`, not `null`.** better-sqlite3's `Statement#get(…)` returns `undefined` when no row matches. A `!== null` guard passes for `undefined` too (`undefined !== null` is `true`), so the guard is always truthy and downstream property access crashes.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
const row = stmt.get(id);
if (row !== null) {
  use(row.v);  // row is undefined → crash
}

// ✅ CORRECT
const row = stmt.get(id);
if (row != null) { use(row.v); }        // catches both null and undefined
// or
if (row === undefined) return null;
// or
return row ?? defaultValue;
```

**2. Attach `once()` listeners BEFORE the triggering syscall.** If the event fires synchronously (fast exit, already-emitted event), a listener attached after the trigger misses it.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — listener can miss sync exit
proc.kill("SIGINT");
await new Promise(resolve => proc.once("exit", resolve));

// ✅ CORRECT — listener first, trigger after
const done = new Promise(resolve => proc.once("exit", resolve));
proc.kill("SIGINT");
await done;
```

**3. `.mjs` importing `.ts` requires `--experimental-strip-types`.** Without the flag (or `--import tsx`, `--loader ts-node`, etc.), Node throws `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`. If your `.mjs` harness imports any `.ts` module, every script that runs it must pass the flag.

```json
// ❌ WRONG
"test:tokens": "node --test studio/test/tokens.test.mjs"

// ✅ CORRECT
"test:tokens": "node --experimental-strip-types --test studio/test/tokens.test.mjs"
```

**Opt-out marker**: `// allow-coderabbit-theme: <reason>` on the same or preceding line, same convention as `allow-source-grep:`. The reason appears in the diff.

## Security

If you find a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue.** Email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting.

## Questions?

Open a discussion on GitHub or ask in the Discord `#maintainers` channel.
