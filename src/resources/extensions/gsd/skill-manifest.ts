// GSD2 + skill-manifest — per-unit-type skill allowlist resolver (RFC #4779)
//
// Each auto-mode unit type can declare which skills are relevant to it. This
// trims the set of skills considered for activation in the per-unit prompt,
// reducing prompt token bloat and sharpening model focus.
//
// Contract:
//   - Unknown unit types fall through to "all skills" (current behavior).
//   - A manifest entry referencing a skill that is not installed is a silent
//     no-op at filter time — the filter passes through installed skills only.
//   - The allowlist is an inclusion list: only skills whose normalized name
//     appears in the allowlist are retained. Order is not preserved.
//
// Phase 1 scope: seed manifests for a small number of unit types as proof.
// Additional unit types can be added incrementally; each addition is a pure
// data change with no wiring cost.
