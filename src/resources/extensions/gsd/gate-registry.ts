/**
 * GSD Gate Registry — single source of truth for quality-gate ownership.
 *
 * Each gate declares which workflow turn owns it, the scope at which it is
 * persisted in the `quality_gates` table, and the question/guidance text used
 * in the prompt that turn sends. The registry replaces the ad-hoc
 * `GATE_QUESTIONS` table that used to live in `auto-prompts.ts`, and every
 * layer of the prompt system (prompt builders, dispatch rules, state
 * derivation, tool handlers) consults it so a pending gate can never be
 * silently dropped.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - `GATE_REGISTRY` is exhaustiveness-checked against `GateId` via
 *     `satisfies Record<GateId, GateDefinition>`, so adding a new GateId
 *     without a registry entry is a compile error.
 *   - `getGatesForTurn(turn)` returns the definitions a turn owns.
 *   - `assertGateCoverage(pending, turn)` throws a GSDError if the pending
 *     list for a turn contains unknown gates, or if any gate owned by the
 *     turn is missing from the pending list.
