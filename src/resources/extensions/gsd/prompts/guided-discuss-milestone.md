Discuss milestone {{milestoneId}} ("{{milestoneTitle}}"). Identify gray areas, ask the user about them, and write `{{milestoneId}}-CONTEXT.md` in the milestone directory with the decisions. Use the **Context** output template below. If a `GSD Skill Preferences` block is present in system context, use it to decide which skills to load and follow; do not override required artifact rules.

## Interview Protocol

{{fastPathInstruction}}

### Before your first question round

Do a lightweight targeted investigation so your questions are grounded in reality:
- Scout the codebase (`rg`, `find`, or `scout`) to understand what already exists that this milestone touches or builds on
- Check the roadmap context above (if present) to understand what surrounds this milestone
- Use `resolve_library` / `get_library_docs` for unfamiliar libraries — prefer this over `search-the-web` for library documentation
- Identify the 3–5 biggest behavioural and architectural unknowns: things where the user's answer will materially change what gets built

**Web search budget:** You have a limited number of web searches per turn (typically 3-5). Prefer `resolve_library` / `get_library_docs` for library documentation and `search_and_read` for one-shot topic research — they are more budget-efficient. Target 2-3 web searches in the investigation pass. Distribute remaining searches across subsequent question rounds rather than clustering them.

Do **not** go deep — just enough that your questions reflect what's actually true rather than what you assume.

### Question rounds

Ask **1–3 questions per round**. Keep each question focused on one of:
- **What they're building** — concrete enough to explain to a stranger
- **Why it needs to exist** — the problem it solves or the desire it fulfills
- **Who it's for** — user, team, themselves
- **What "done" looks like** — observable outcomes, not abstract goals
- **The biggest technical unknowns / risks** — what could fail, what hasn't been proven
- **What external systems/services this touches** — APIs, databases, third-party services

**If `{{structuredQuestionsAvailable}}` is `true`:** use `ask_user_questions` for each round. 1–3 questions per call, each as a separate question object. Keep option labels short (3–5 words). Always include a freeform "Other / let me explain" option. When the user picks that option or writes a long freeform answer, switch to plain text follow-up for that thread before resuming structured questions. **IMPORTANT: Call `ask_user_questions` exactly once per turn. Never make multiple calls with the same or overlapping questions — wait for the user's response before asking the next round.**

**If `{{structuredQuestionsAvailable}}` is `false`:** ask questions in plain text. Keep each round to 1–3 focused questions. Wait for answers before asking the next round.

After the user answers, investigate further if any answer opens a new unknown, then ask the next round.

### Round cadence

After each round of answers, decide whether you already have enough depth to write a strong context file.

- **Incremental persistence:** After every 2 question rounds, silently save a `{{milestoneId}}-CONTEXT-DRAFT.md` with your current understanding using `gsd_summary_save` with `artifact_type: "CONTEXT-DRAFT"`. This protects against session crashes losing all confirmed work. Do NOT mention this save to the user — it's invisible bookkeeping. The final context file will overwrite it.
- If not ready, investigate any newly-opened unknowns and continue to the next round immediately. Do **not** ask a meta "ready to wrap up?" question after every round.
- Use a single wrap-up prompt only when you genuinely believe the depth checklist is satisfied or the user signals they want to stop.
- **If `{{structuredQuestionsAvailable}}` is `true` and you need that wrap-up prompt:** use `ask_user_questions` with options:
  - "Write the context file" *(recommended when depth is satisfied)*
  - "One more pass"
- **If `{{structuredQuestionsAvailable}}` is `false`:** ask in plain text only once you believe you are ready to write.

## Questioning philosophy

**Start open, follow energy.** Let the user's enthusiasm guide where you dig deeper.

**Challenge vagueness, make abstract concrete.** When the user says something abstract ("it should be smart" / "good UX"), push for specifics.

**Lead with experience, but ask implementation when it materially matters.** Default questions should target the experience and outcome. But when implementation choices materially change scope, proof, compliance, integration, deployment, or irreversible architecture, ask them directly instead of forcing a fake UX phrasing.

**Position-first framing.** Have opinions. "I'd lean toward X because Y — does that match your thinking?" is better than "what do you think about X vs Y?"

**Negative constraints.** Ask what would disappoint them. What they explicitly don't want. Negative constraints are sharper than positive wishes.

**Anti-patterns — never do these:**
- Checklist walking through predetermined topics regardless of what the user said
- Canned generic questions that could apply to any project
- Corporate speak ("What are your key success metrics?")
- Rapid-fire questions without acknowledging answers
- Asking about technical skill level

## Depth Verification

Before moving to the wrap-up gate, verify you have covered:

- [ ] What they're building — concrete enough to explain to a stranger
- [ ] Why it needs to exist
- [ ] Who it's for
- [ ] What "done" looks like
- [ ] The biggest technical unknowns / risks
- [ ] What external systems/services this touches

**Print a structured depth summary in chat first** — using the user's own terminology. Cover what you understood, what shaped your understanding, and any areas of remaining uncertainty.

**Then confirm:**

**If `{{structuredQuestionsAvailable}}` is `true`:** use `ask_user_questions` with:
- header: "Depth Check"
- question: "Did I capture the depth right?"
- options: "Yes, you got it (Recommended)", "Not quite — let me clarify"
- **The question ID must contain `depth_verification`** (e.g. `depth_verification_confirm`) — this enables the write-gate downstream.

**If `{{structuredQuestionsAvailable}}` is `false`:** ask in plain text: "Did I capture that correctly? If not, tell me what I missed." Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding. **The same non-bypassable gate applies to the plain-text path** — if the user does not respond, gives an ambiguous answer, or does not explicitly confirm, you MUST re-ask. Never rationalize past a missing confirmation.

If they clarify, absorb the correction and re-verify.

The depth verification is the only required confirmation gate. Do not add a second "ready to proceed?" gate after it.

**CRITICAL — Non-bypassable gate:** The system mechanically blocks CONTEXT.md writes until the user selects the "(Recommended)" option (structured path) or explicitly confirms (plain-text path). If the user declines, cancels, does not respond, or the tool fails, you MUST re-ask — never rationalize past the block ("tool not responding, I'll proceed" is forbidden). The gate exists to protect the user's work; treat a block as an instruction, not an obstacle to work around.

## Output

Once the user confirms depth:

1. Use the **Context** output template below
2. `mkdir -p` the milestone directory if needed
3. Call `gsd_summary_save` with `milestone_id: {{milestoneId}}`, `artifact_type: "CONTEXT"`, and the full context markdown as `content` — the tool writes the file to disk and persists to DB. Preserve the user's exact terminology, emphasis, and framing in the content. Do not paraphrase nuance into generic summaries. The context file is downstream agents' only window into this conversation.
4. {{commitInstruction}}
5. Say exactly: `"{{milestoneId}} context written."` — nothing else.
