// GSD-2 — UnitContextManifest (#4782 phase 1).
//
// Declarative description of what context each auto-mode unit type needs
// in its system prompt. Establishes the contract that later phases will
// use to drive a single composeSystemPromptForUnit() — replacing the
// per-unit-type branching currently spread across `auto-prompts.ts`.
//
// **Phase 1 ships the type + the data + a CI coverage guard.** It adds
// zero wiring — no caller reads a manifest yet. Every unit type gets a
// manifest that describes today's behavior as faithfully as possible, so
// when the composer lands in phase 2 the migration can proceed manifest-
// by-manifest without behavior change.
//
// Phased rollout tracking:
//   - Phase 1 (this PR): schema + manifests + coverage test.
//   - Phase 2: add composeSystemPromptForUnit(); migrate one low-risk
//     unit type (e.g. reassess-roadmap) as the pilot.
//   - Phase 3: migrate remaining unit types, tighten manifests per
//     empirical usage, introduce skipWhen predicates absorbing the
//     reassess opt-in gate from #4778.
//   - Phase 4: introduce pipeline variants as declared sequences,
//     absorbing the scope-classifier gates from #4781.
//
// Naming:
//   - Artifact keys are STABLE strings (not paths). Path resolution is
//     the composer's job; manifests describe intent, not disk layout.
//   - Char budgets are nominal — blown budgets log a telemetry event,
//     they do not truncate or error (the composer decides fallback).
