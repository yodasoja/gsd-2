// gsd-2 / Deep planning mode — Regression coverage for hasPendingDeepStage()
// being exported and consumed by the showSmartEntry deep-mode kickoff branch.
//
// Context: PR #5094 wires a deep-mode branch into showSmartEntry that calls
// hasPendingDeepStage() to decide whether to hand off to startAutoDetached().
// Without this guard, /gsd new-project --deep set the planning_depth flag but
// never actually triggered the staged interview because showSmartEntry fell
// straight through to the standard milestone wizard. These tests pin the
// exported contract so the kickoff branch can rely on it.
