// GSD-2 — Worktree State Projection module: directional state-flow rules between project root and auto-worktree.
/**
 * Worktree State Projection module — first-class Module for directional
 * state-file flow between the project root and the auto-worktree.
 *
 * Per ADR-016, this Module owns:
 *   - The direction-and-rules of state file flow (project-root authoritative
 *     for some classes, worktree authoritative for others)
 *   - The bug-hardened invariants encoded in `syncProjectRootToWorktree` /
 *     `syncStateToProjectRoot` (additive milestone copy #1886, ASSESSMENT
 *     verdict overwrite #2821, completed-units forward-sync, WAL/SHM
 *     cleanup #2478, .gsd symlink edge case #2184)
 *
 * Phase 1 shipped `projectRootToWorktree`; this slice also introduces
 * `projectWorktreeToRoot` as a delegating wrapper. `finalizeProjectionForMerge`
 * remains for a subsequent slice (#5590).
 *
 * Issue #5588 ships this as a delegating wrapper around the existing
 * `syncProjectRootToWorktree*` helpers in `auto-worktree.ts`. The full body
 * extraction (with its identity-key check, additive milestone copy, ASSESSMENT
 * verdict force-overwrite, completed-units forward-sync, WAL/SHM cleanup,
 * .gsd symlink edge case) joins the legacy helper retirement in #5590.
 *
 * Lifecycle does not yet hook this Module into `enterMilestone`; that wiring
 * lands when the broader caller migration completes alongside the Projection
 * Module's full Interface.
