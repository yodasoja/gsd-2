**Slice:** {{sliceId}} — {{sliceTitle}}
**Milestone:** {{milestoneId}}

## Description

{{description}}

## Failure Modes

<!-- Q5: What breaks when dependencies fail? OMIT ENTIRELY for tasks with no external dependencies. -->

| Dependency | On error | On timeout | On malformed response |
|------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| {{dependency}} | {{errorStrategy}} | {{timeoutStrategy}} | {{malformedStrategy}} |

## Load Profile

<!-- Q6: What breaks at 10x load? OMIT ENTIRELY for tasks with no shared resources or scaling concerns. -->

- **Shared resources**: {{sharedResources — DB connections, caches, rate limiters, or none}}
- **Per-operation cost**: {{perOpCost — N API calls, M DB queries, K bytes, or trivial}}
- **10x breakpoint**: {{whatBreaksFirst — pool exhaustion, rate limit, memory, or N/A}}

## Negative Tests

<!-- Q7: What negative tests prove robustness? OMIT ENTIRELY for trivial tasks. -->

- **Malformed inputs**: {{malformedInputTests — empty string, null, oversized, wrong type}}
- **Error paths**: {{errorPathTests — network timeout, auth failure, 5xx, invalid JSON}}
- **Boundary conditions**: {{boundaryTests — empty list, max length, zero, off-by-one}}

## Must-Haves

## Verification

- {{howToVerifyThisTaskIsActuallyDone}}
- {{commandToRun_OR_behaviorToCheck}}

## Verify Rules

- Use a real executable check, not prose.
- If the check needs file-content assertions, write a `node:test` file and run it with `node --test` or a package test script.
- Do not use inline `node -e` assertions for verification.

## Observability Impact

<!-- OMIT THIS SECTION ENTIRELY for simple tasks that don't touch runtime boundaries,
     async flows, APIs, background processes, or error paths.
     Include it only when the task meaningfully changes how failures are detected or diagnosed. -->

- Signals added/changed: {{structured logs, statuses, errors, metrics}}
- How a future agent inspects this: {{command, endpoint, file, UI state}}
- Failure state exposed: {{what becomes visible on failure}}

## Inputs

<!-- Every input MUST be a backtick-wrapped file path. These paths are machine-parsed to
     derive task dependencies — vague descriptions without paths break dependency detection.
     For the first task in a slice with no prior task outputs, list the existing source files
     this task reads or modifies.
     Tool field: inputs must be an array of strings, e.g. ["src/index.ts"], never a single string. -->

## Expected Output

<!-- Every output MUST be a backtick-wrapped file path — the specific files this task creates
     or modifies. These paths are machine-parsed to derive task dependencies.
     This task should produce a real increment toward making the slice goal/demo true. A full
     slice plan should not be able to mark every task complete while the claimed slice behavior
     still does not work at the stated proof level.
     Tool field: expectedOutput must be an array of strings, e.g. ["src/index.ts"], never a single string. -->
