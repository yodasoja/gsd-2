/**
 * GSD Command — /gsd extract-learnings
 *
 * Analyses completed milestone artefacts and dispatches an LLM turn that
 * extracts structured knowledge into 4 categories (Decisions · Lessons ·
 * Patterns · Surprises), writes a LEARNINGS.md audit trail, and persists
 * the durable subset into the GSD memory store via capture_thought:
 *
 *   - Patterns  → capture_thought(category="pattern")
 *   - Lessons   → capture_thought(category="gotcha" | "convention")
 *   - Decisions → capture_thought(category="architecture", structuredFields=...)
 *   - Surprises → stay only in LEARNINGS.md (milestone-local context).
 *
 * Per ADR-013 step 6 (cutover), the memories table is the single source of
 * truth for cross-session durable knowledge. The legacy KNOWLEDGE.md table
 * appends and gsd_save_decision call-outs were removed from this flow; the
 * pre-existing decisions table was migrated by the step 5 backfill.
 *
 * The same extraction steps are reused by the complete-milestone prompt
 * via buildExtractionStepsBlock — single source of truth.

  return `## Structured Learnings Extraction

Perform the following steps IN ORDER. Each step is mandatory unless explicitly
marked optional. These instructions are the single source of truth shared by
\`/gsd extract-learnings\` and the auto-mode milestone-completion turn.

### Step 1 — Classify findings into four categories

Review the milestone artefacts (roadmap, slice summaries, verification report,
UAT report) and structure your findings into exactly four categories:

- **Decisions** — architectural or design choices made during this milestone, including rationale and alternatives considered.
- **Lessons** — technical discoveries, process insights, knowledge gaps that were filled.
- **Patterns** — reusable approaches or solutions that emerged and should be applied in future work.
- **Surprises** — unexpected challenges, discoveries, or outcomes that deviated from assumptions.

Every item MUST carry a \`Source:\` line using the format
\`Source: {artifact-filename}/{section}\` (e.g.
\`Source: ${ctx.milestoneId}-ROADMAP.md/Architecture Decisions\`).
Items without a source attribution are invalid — drop them.

### Step 2 — Write the LEARNINGS.md audit trail

Using the \`write\` tool, persist the full structured report to
\`${ctx.relativeOutputPath}\` with this shape:

- YAML frontmatter with keys: \`phase\`, \`phase_name\`, \`project\`, \`generated\` (ISO-8601 UTC), \`counts\` (decisions / lessons / patterns / surprises), \`missing_artifacts\`.
- Four H3 sections (\`### Decisions\`, \`### Lessons\`, \`### Patterns\`, \`### Surprises\`) containing bullet points. Each bullet is followed by its \`Source:\` line.

LEARNINGS.md is the full, cited audit trail. Write it first — subsequent steps
feed from its content.

### Step 3 — Run one bounded duplicate check

Before persisting extracted items in Steps 4–6, do at most one duplicate-check
pass for the durable Decisions, Lessons, and Patterns from this milestone. Use
the already-written LEARNINGS.md content and call \`memory_query\` once with a
compact keyword summary for the whole batch. If that result clearly shows a
semantically equivalent high-confidence memory for an item, mark only that item
as already captured and skip it in its respective persistence step.

Do not re-read milestone artefacts or repeat memory queries category-by-category
after this point. The memory store is the single source of truth for
cross-session durable knowledge — no other persistence call is part of this
flow.

### Step 4 — Persist Patterns via \`capture_thought\`

For each extracted Pattern, call \`capture_thought\` exactly once with:
- \`category: "pattern"\`
- \`content\`: a 1–2 sentence restatement combining the Pattern, Where, and any non-obvious notes
- \`scope: "${ctx.milestoneId}"\`

Skip the call if a high-confidence semantic duplicate is already present
(see Step 7 dedup rule).

### Step 5 — Persist Lessons via \`capture_thought\`

For each extracted Lesson, call \`capture_thought\` exactly once with:
- \`category: "gotcha"\` when the Lesson describes a pitfall, surprise root cause, or recurring failure mode; \`category: "convention"\` when it describes a project-wide rule or normative practice
- \`content\`: a 1–3 sentence restatement of What Happened + Root Cause + Fix
- \`scope: "${ctx.milestoneId}"\`

Skip the call if a high-confidence semantic duplicate is already present
(see Step 7 dedup rule).

### Step 6 — Persist Decisions via \`capture_thought\`

For each extracted Decision, call \`capture_thought\` exactly once with:
- \`category: "architecture"\`
- \`content\`: a 1–3 sentence restatement combining decision + choice + rationale (e.g. "Chose X over Y because Z")
- \`scope: "${ctx.milestoneId}"\`
- \`structuredFields\`: an object preserving the original decision schema:
  \`{ scope: "${ctx.milestoneId}", decision: <question>, choice: <option>, rationale: <why>, made_by: "agent", revisable: "yes" | "no" | omit }\`

Skip the call if a high-confidence semantic duplicate is already present.

The structured payload is required for architecture-category memories so
later projection back to a human-visible decisions register stays lossless
(ADR-013 source-of-truth boundaries).

### Step 7 — Deduplication rule (applies to Steps 4, 5, 6)

Use only the duplicate-check result from Step 3. If that bounded check returned
a semantically equivalent memory at high confidence for an extracted item, skip
the capture entirely. Otherwise, persist the item once via \`capture_thought\`.
Prefer skipping a near-duplicate over creating a second slightly-different row
— redundancy degrades the signal.

### Step 8 — Surprises stay only in LEARNINGS.md

Surprises are milestone-local context and are NOT cross-session-reusable. Do
not persist them via \`capture_thought\` or any other MCP tool. They are
captured only in the LEARNINGS.md file written in Step 2.`;

## Your Task

Analyse the milestone artefacts inlined below and follow the Structured
Learnings Extraction procedure in full. The procedure writes LEARNINGS.md
as the milestone-local audit trail and persists the durable subset into the
GSD memory store via \`capture_thought\` (categories: pattern, gotcha or
convention, architecture). The memory store is the single source of truth
for cross-session durable knowledge (ADR-013).
