// GSD-2 — UnitContextComposer (#4782 phase 2).
//
// Reads a unit type's manifest and orchestrates artifact inlining through
// a caller-provided resolver. Returns a joined context block suitable for
// substitution into the unit's prompt template.
//
// Design rationale:
//   - Pure dependency on the manifest module — no circular import with
//     `auto-prompts.ts` where the per-artifact-key resolver lives.
//   - Caller-supplied resolver means the composer can be unit-tested with
//     trivial mocks; production wiring in `auto-prompts.ts` dispatches to
//     the existing `inlineFile` / `inline*FromDb` helpers.
//   - Null-returning resolvers are skipped silently: they model the
//     "artifact is optional / missing / not applicable to this milestone"
//     case. The composer never errors on a missing artifact.
//
// Scope: phase 2 pilot shipped `composeInlinedContext` for static-key
// inlining. Phase 3.5 (#4924) adds the v2 surface — `composeUnitContext`
// — which also handles excerpts, computed artifacts, and prepended blocks.
// `composeInlinedContext` stays for backward compatibility with the
// already-migrated simple builders.
//
// ─── Composer boundary invariant (#4924) ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The composer is allowed to:
//   - order named sections per the manifest's declared sequence
//   - resolve registered artifacts (static / computed / excerpt / on-demand)
//   - apply typed policies (knowledge / memory / codebase-map / preferences)
//
// The composer must NOT grow:
//   - arbitrary conditionals on unit state
//   - loops over caller-supplied data
//   - string templating beyond section composition (join + separator)
//
// Logic that needs those belongs in a typed computed-artifact builder
// owned by the unit, not in the composer. Reviews must enforce this — it
// is the difference between an orchestrator and a runaway DSL.
