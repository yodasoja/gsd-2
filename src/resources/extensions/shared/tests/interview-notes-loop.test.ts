// GSD2 — Regression test for interview-ui "None of the above" notes loop
// Copyright (c) 2026 Jeremy McSpadden <jeremy@fluxlabs.net>

/**
 * Regression test for bug #3502:
 *
 * Selecting "None of the above" opens the notes field, but pressing Enter
 * after typing a note called goNextOrSubmit() which saw the cursor still
 * on the "None of the above" slot and re-opened notes — trapping the user
 * in an infinite loop.
 *
 * The fix adds a `!states[currentIdx].notes` guard so auto-open only fires
 * when notes are still empty.
