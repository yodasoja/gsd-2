// Regression for #4470: /gsd onboarding re-entry used to replay the @clack
// first-run wizard, which wedged the TUI (clack takes over raw stdin and
// pauses it on teardown) and rendered a duplicate intro/logo header.
//
// The fix replaces re-entry with a ctx.ui.select setup hub owned by the TUI.
// These assertions guarantee the handler does NOT invoke runOnboarding (the
// clack wizard) and therefore cannot re-render the intro/logo or wedge stdin.
