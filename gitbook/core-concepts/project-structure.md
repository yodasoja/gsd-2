# How GSD Organizes Work

GSD uses a three-level hierarchy to break projects into manageable pieces that an AI can execute reliably.

## The Hierarchy

```
Milestone  →  a shippable version (4-10 slices)
  Slice    →  one demoable vertical feature (1-7 tasks)
    Task   →  one context-window-sized unit of work
```

### Milestones

A milestone is a shippable version of your project — an MVP, a major release, or a feature set that delivers standalone value. Milestones typically contain 4-10 slices.

Examples:
- "MVP with user auth, dashboard, and settings"
- "v2.0 with real-time collaboration and API v2"
- "Security hardening milestone"

### Slices

A slice is one demoable, vertical capability within a milestone. It cuts across layers (database, backend, frontend) to deliver something you could show to a user. Slices contain 1-7 tasks.

Examples:
- "User authentication with JWT"
- "Dashboard layout with charts"
- "API rate limiting"

### Tasks

A task is the smallest unit of work — something that fits in one AI context window. If a task can't be completed in a single AI session, it's broken into smaller tasks.

Examples:
- "Create the User model and migration"
- "Implement JWT middleware"
- "Build the login form component"

## Project State

GSD keeps authoritative runtime state in the project-root SQLite database and renders markdown projections into `.gsd/` for review, prompts, and git history. The markdown files are useful to read and commit, but completion status and queue position come from the database unless you run an explicit import or recovery command.

The `.gsd/` directory looks like this:

```
.gsd/
  gsd.db              — authoritative runtime database (local, gitignored)
  PROJECT.md          — living description of what the project is
  REQUIREMENTS.md     — requirement contract (active/validated/deferred)
  DECISIONS.md        — projected architectural decisions log
  KNOWLEDGE.md        — manual rules plus projected patterns and lessons
  RUNTIME.md          — runtime context: API endpoints, env vars, services
  STATE.md            — quick-glance status of current work
  PREFERENCES.md      — project-level preferences (optional)
  milestones/
    M001/
      M001-ROADMAP.md — slice plan with risk levels and dependencies
      M001-CONTEXT.md — scope and goals from discussion phase
      slices/
        S01/
          S01-PLAN.md     — task decomposition for this slice
          S01-SUMMARY.md  — what was built and what changed
          S01-UAT.md      — human test script
          tasks/
            T01-PLAN.md   — detailed plan for this task
            T01-SUMMARY.md — what the task accomplished
```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PROJECT.md` | High-level project description, updated as the project evolves |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Formal requirement contract — tracks what's active, validated, and deferred |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Projected architectural decisions with rationale, rendered from memory-backed decision rows |
| `KNOWLEDGE.md` | Manual Rules plus memory-projected Patterns and Lessons. GSD injects Rules from the file and injects Patterns/Lessons through the memory block at the start of every task |
| `RUNTIME.md` | Runtime context like API URLs, ports, and environment variables |
| `gsd.db` | Authoritative runtime state for workflow hierarchy, completion, requirements, memory-backed decisions/knowledge, and summaries |
| `STATE.md` | Current status at a glance — rendered from the database, don't edit manually |

## How Work Flows

Each slice flows through phases:

```
Plan → Execute (per task) → Complete → Reassess Roadmap → Next Slice
```

1. **Plan** — GSD scouts the codebase, researches relevant docs, and decomposes the slice into tasks with clear requirements
2. **Execute** — Each task runs in a fresh AI session with focused context
3. **Complete** — GSD writes summaries, generates a UAT script, and commits
4. **Reassess** — The roadmap is checked against reality — slices may be reordered, added, or removed
5. **Next Slice** — The loop continues until all slices are done

After all slices complete, a **milestone validation** gate checks that success criteria were actually met before sealing the milestone.

## Adding Knowledge

GSD maintains a knowledge base that persists across sessions. Add rules, patterns, or lessons:

```
/gsd knowledge rule "Always use parameterized queries for database access"
/gsd knowledge pattern "Service classes go in src/services/"
/gsd knowledge lesson "The OAuth flow requires the redirect URL to match exactly"
```

Rules append directly to `.gsd/KNOWLEDGE.md`. Patterns and Lessons are stored as memories, projected back into `.gsd/KNOWLEDGE.md` for review, and injected into task prompts through the memory block.
