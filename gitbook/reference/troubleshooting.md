# Troubleshooting

## `/gsd doctor`

The built-in diagnostic tool validates `.gsd/` integrity:

```
/gsd doctor
```

It checks file structure, roadmap ↔ slice ↔ task consistency, completion state, git health, stale locks, orphaned records, and disk-only milestone stubs.

## Common Issues

### Auto mode loops on the same unit

The same unit dispatches repeatedly.

**Fix:** Run `/gsd doctor` to repair state, then `/gsd auto`. If it persists, check that the expected artifact file exists on disk.

### Auto mode stops with "Loop detected"

A unit failed to produce its expected artifact twice.

**Fix:** Check the task plan for clarity. Refine it manually, then `/gsd auto`.

### `command not found: gsd` after install

npm's global bin directory isn't in `$PATH`.

**Fix:**
```bash
npm prefix -g
# Add the bin dir to PATH:
echo 'export PATH="$(npm prefix -g)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Common causes:**
- **Homebrew Node** — `/opt/homebrew/bin` missing from PATH
- **Version manager (nvm, fnm, mise)** — global bin is version-specific
- **oh-my-zsh** — `gitfast` plugin aliases `gsd` to `git svn dcommit`; check with `alias gsd`

### Provider errors during auto mode

| Error Type | Auto-Resume? | Delay |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Rate limit (429) | Yes | 60s or retry-after header |
| Server error (500, 502, 503) | Yes | 30s |
| Auth/billing ("unauthorized") | No | Manual resume required |

For permanent errors, configure fallback models:

```yaml
models:
  execution:
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    fallbacks:
      - openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5
```

### Budget ceiling reached

Auto mode pauses with "Budget ceiling reached."

**Fix:** Increase `budget_ceiling` in preferences, or switch to `budget` token profile, then `/gsd auto`.

### Stale lock file

Auto mode won't start, says another session is running.

**Fix:** GSD auto-detects stale locks (dead PID = auto cleanup). If automatic recovery fails:

```bash
rm -f .gsd/auto.lock
rm -rf "$(dirname .gsd)/.gsd.lock"
```

### Git merge conflicts

Worktree merge fails on `.gsd/` files.

**Fix:** `.gsd/` conflicts are auto-resolved. Code conflicts get an AI fix attempt; if that fails, resolve manually.

### Work stranded in a worktree after an interrupted session

Auto mode was paused, stopped, or crashed mid-milestone, and the work is still on the `milestone/<MID>` branch in `.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/` — never merged back to main. Next session reports the milestone as incomplete or behaving inconsistently.

**Fix:** As of GSD 2.78, `/gsd auto` bootstrap automatically detects this condition and surfaces a warning naming the branch, commit count, and worktree location. Run `/gsd auto` to re-enter the worktree and resume; or merge `milestone/<MID>` into main manually if abandoning.

**Diagnose:** Run `/gsd forensics` and look at the **Worktree Telemetry** section:
- `Orphans detected > 0` with reason `in-progress-unmerged` confirms the condition
- `Unmerged exits > 0` on the producer side confirms which exit type caused it

**Prevent recurrence:** If your milestones are large or sessions are frequently interrupted, consider setting `git.collapse_cadence: "slice"` in preferences — validated slices merge to main immediately, shrinking the orphan window from milestone-size to slice-size. See [Git & Worktrees](../configuration/git-settings.md#collapse-cadence).

### `orphan_milestone_dir` doctor warning

`/gsd doctor` can report `orphan_milestone_dir` when `.gsd/milestones/<MID>/` exists on disk but has no DB row, no matching `.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/` worktree, and no milestone content files. This is a disk-only stub, not stranded work, and it can skew future milestone ID generation.

**Fix:** Run `/gsd doctor fix` to remove the orphan stub directory automatically. The fix only removes these empty disk-only milestone stubs; populated milestone directories and in-flight worktree-only milestones are preserved.

### Notifications not appearing on macOS

**Fix:** Install `terminal-notifier`:

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

See [Notifications](../configuration/notifications.md) for details.

## MCP Issues

### No servers configured

**Fix:** Add server to `.mcp.json` or `.gsd/mcp.json`, verify JSON is valid, run `mcp_servers(refresh=true)`.

### Server discovery times out

**Fix:** Run the configured command outside GSD to confirm it starts. Check that backend services are reachable.

### Server connection closed immediately

**Fix:** Verify `command` and `args` paths are correct and absolute. Run the command manually to catch errors.

## Recovery Procedures

### Reset auto mode state

```bash
rm .gsd/auto.lock
rm .gsd/completed-units.json
```

Then `/gsd auto` to restart from current state.

### Reset routing history

```bash
rm .gsd/routing-history.json
```

### Refresh rendered state

```
/gsd doctor
```

Checks the authoritative database, refreshes `STATE.md` from derived database state, and fixes projection or runtime-file inconsistencies.

### Recover database hierarchy from markdown

Use this only when the database is missing, damaged, or known to be stale but the rendered milestone, slice, and task markdown on disk is the best available source:

```
/gsd recover
```

`/gsd recover` clears and reconstructs the database hierarchy tables from markdown, then derives state again to verify the result. Normal runtime does not silently import markdown projections, and worktree markdown is not synced back as authoritative state.

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues:** [github.com/gsd-build/GSD-2/issues](https://github.com/gsd-build/GSD-2/issues)
- **Dashboard:** `Ctrl+Alt+G` or `/gsd status`
- **Forensics:** `/gsd forensics` for post-mortem analysis
- **Session logs:** `.gsd/activity/` contains JSONL session dumps

## Platform-Specific Issues

### iTerm2

`Ctrl+Alt` shortcuts trigger wrong actions → Set **Profiles → Keys → General → Left Option Key** to **Esc+**.

### Windows

- LSP ENOENT on MSYS2/Git Bash → Fixed in v2.29+, upgrade
- EBUSY errors during builds → Close browser extension, or change output directory
- Transient EBUSY/EPERM on `.gsd/` files → Retry; close file-locking tools if persistent
