### Bare `/gsd` Smart Launcher

Bare `/gsd` opens a state-aware launcher wizard in interactive sessions. It checks whether the project is initialized, whether auto-mode is active, whether an interrupted session can resume, and where the current milestone is in the workflow, then highlights a recommended action.

| Project state | Recommended action |
|---------------|--------------------|
| No `.gsd/` directory | Initialize project |
| Initialized with no milestones | Quick task when available; otherwise create the first milestone |
| Recoverable interrupted session | Resume |
| Auto-mode already active | View status, with stop available |
| Milestone needs context or a roadmap | Discuss first |
| Roadmap-ready work | Step next, with auto available |
| Current milestones complete | Start a new milestone |

Use `/gsd next` when you want to skip the launcher and directly run one step. Use `/gsd auto` when you want continuous execution.

## GSD Worktree Commands

Use `/gsd worktree` from an active TUI session to inspect and clean up GSD-managed worktrees without leaving the conversation. `/gsd wt` is an alias.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd worktree list` | Show each worktree, branch, path, clean/unmerged/uncommitted status, diff stats, and commit count. Alias: `/gsd worktree ls`. |
| `/gsd worktree merge [name]` | Merge a worktree into the detected main branch, then remove the worktree and its branch. The name is optional only when exactly one worktree exists. |
| `/gsd worktree clean` | Remove only merged or empty worktrees. Worktrees with unmerged diffs or uncommitted changes are kept. |
| `/gsd worktree remove <name> [--force]` | Remove a named worktree and delete its branch. Refuses unmerged or uncommitted work unless `--force` is supplied. Alias: `/gsd worktree rm`. |

Safety behavior:

- `merge` auto-commits dirty worktree changes before merging when possible.
- `merge` refuses to continue if the project root is not on the detected main branch; check out the main branch and rerun it.
- `clean` never deletes worktrees with pending file changes.
- `remove` requires `--force` to discard unmerged or uncommitted work.

## In-Session Update

```
/gsd update
```

Checks npm for a newer version and installs it without leaving the session.
