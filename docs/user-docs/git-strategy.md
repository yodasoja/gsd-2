# Git Strategy

GSD uses git for milestone isolation and sequential commits within each milestone. You choose an **isolation mode** that controls where work happens. The strategy is fully automated — you don't need to manage branches manually.

## Isolation Modes

GSD supports three isolation modes, configured via the `git.isolation` preference:

| Mode | Working Directory | Branch | Best For |
|------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| `none` (default) | Project root | Current branch (no milestone branch) | Most projects — no isolation overhead |
| `worktree` | `.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/` | `milestone/<MID>` | Projects that need full file isolation between milestones |
| `branch` | Project root | `milestone/<MID>` | Submodule-heavy repos where worktrees don't work well |

### `none` Mode (Default)

Work happens directly on your current branch. No worktree, no milestone branch. GSD still commits sequentially with conventional commit messages, but there's no branch isolation.

Use this for hot-reload workflows where file isolation breaks dev tooling (e.g., file watchers that only see the project root), or for small projects where branch overhead isn't worth it.

### `worktree` Mode

Each milestone gets its own git worktree at `.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/` on a `milestone/<MID>` branch. All execution happens inside the worktree. On completion, the worktree is squash-merged to main as one clean commit. The worktree and branch are then cleaned up.

This provides full file isolation — changes in a milestone can't interfere with your main working copy.

Worktree mode requires the repository to have at least one commit. If `git.isolation: worktree` is configured in a zero-commit repo with no committed `HEAD`, GSD temporarily runs as `none` so startup can continue. After the first commit exists, the same preference resolves to `worktree`.

### `branch` Mode

Work happens in the project root on a `milestone/<MID>` branch. No worktree is created. On completion, the branch is merged to main (squash or regular merge, per `merge_strategy`).

Use this when worktrees cause problems — submodule-heavy repos, repos with hardcoded paths, or environments where worktree symlinks don't behave.

## Branching Model (Worktree Mode)

```
main ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  │                                                     ↑
  └── milestone/M001 (worktree) ────────────────────────┘
       commit: feat: core types
       commit: feat: markdown parser
       commit: feat: file writer
       commit: docs: workflow docs
       ...
       → squash-merged to main as single commit
```

In **branch mode**, the flow is the same except work happens in the project root instead of a separate worktree directory.

In **none mode**, commits land directly on the current branch — no milestone branch is created, and no merge step is needed.

### Parallel Worktrees

With [parallel orchestration](./parallel-orchestration.md) enabled, multiple milestones run in separate worktrees simultaneously:

```
main ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  │                                      ↑              ↑
  ├── milestone/M002 (worktree) ─────────┘              │
  │    commit: feat: auth types                         │
  │    commit: feat: JWT middleware                     │
  │    → squash-merged first                            │
  │                                                     │
  └── milestone/M003 (worktree) ────────────────────────┘
       commit: feat: dashboard layout
       commit: feat: chart components
       → squash-merged second
```

Each worktree operates on its own branch with its own commit history. Merges happen sequentially to avoid conflicts.

### Key Properties

- **Sequential commits on one branch** — no per-slice branches, no merge conflicts within a milestone
- **Squash merge to main** — in worktree and branch modes, all commits are squashed into one clean commit on main (configurable via `merge_strategy`)

### Commit Format

Commits use conventional commit format with GSD metadata in trailers:

```
feat: core type definitions

GSD-Task: M001/S01/T01

feat: markdown parser for plan files

GSD-Task: M001/S01/T02
```

## Worktree Management

These features apply only in **worktree mode**.

### Automatic (Auto Mode)

Auto mode creates and manages worktrees automatically:

1. When a milestone starts, a worktree is created at `.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/` on branch `milestone/<MID>`
2. The project-root SQLite database remains canonical runtime state; artifact/projection files are rendered under the active worktree-local `.gsd/` while execution runs inside that worktree
   SQLite WAL coordination is single-host only; do not share this runtime across machines, and see `src/resources/extensions/gsd/docs/COORDINATION.md` for the coordination constraints.
3. All execution happens inside the worktree
4. On milestone completion, the worktree is squash-merged to the integration branch
5. The worktree and branch are removed

### Manual

Use the `/worktree` (or `/wt`) command for standalone manual worktree management:

```
/worktree create
/worktree switch
/worktree merge
/worktree remove
```

Inside an active GSD TUI session, use `/gsd worktree` (or `/gsd wt`) for worktree commands that report through the session UI:

```
/gsd worktree list
/gsd worktree merge [name]
/gsd worktree clean
/gsd worktree remove <name> [--force]
```

`list` shows each worktree's branch, path, diff stats, commit count, and whether it is clean, unmerged, or has uncommitted changes. `merge` brings a worktree back into the detected main branch and removes it afterward; if the worktree has dirty files, GSD tries to auto-commit them before merging. `clean` removes only merged or empty worktrees and keeps anything with pending changes. `remove` refuses to discard unmerged or uncommitted work unless you pass `--force`.

## Workflow Modes

Instead of configuring each git setting individually, set `mode` to get sensible defaults for your workflow:

```yaml
mode: solo    # personal projects — auto-push, squash, simple IDs
mode: team    # shared repos — unique IDs, push branches, pre-merge checks
```

| Setting | `solo` | `team` |
|---|---|---|
| `git.auto_push` | `true` | `false` |
| `git.push_branches` | `false` | `true` |
| `git.pre_merge_check` | `false` | `true` |
| `git.merge_strategy` | `"squash"` | `"squash"` |
| `git.isolation` | `"none"` | `"none"` |
| `git.commit_docs` | `true` | `true` |
| `unique_milestone_ids` | `false` | `true` |

Mode defaults are the lowest priority — any explicit preference overrides them. For example, `mode: solo` with `git.auto_push: false` gives you everything from solo except auto-push.

Existing configs without `mode` work exactly as before — no defaults are injected.

## Git Preferences

Configure git behavior in preferences:

```yaml
git:
  auto_push: false            # push after commits
  push_branches: false        # push milestone branch
  remote: origin
  snapshots: false            # WIP snapshot commits
  pre_merge_check: false      # pre-merge validation
  commit_type: feat           # override commit type prefix
  main_branch: main           # primary branch name
  commit_docs: true           # commit .gsd/ to git
  isolation: none             # "none" (default), "worktree", or "branch"
  auto_pr: false              # create PR on milestone completion
  pr_target_branch: develop   # PR target branch (default: main)
```

### Automatic Pull Requests

For teams using Gitflow or branch-based workflows, GSD can automatically create a pull request when a milestone completes:

```yaml
git:
  auto_push: true
  auto_pr: true
  pr_target_branch: develop
```

This pushes the milestone branch and creates a PR targeting `develop` (or whichever branch you specify). Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated. See [git.auto_pr](./configuration.md#gitauto_pr) for details.
```

### `commit_docs: false`

When set to `false`, GSD adds `.gsd/` to `.gitignore` and keeps all planning artifacts local-only. Useful for teams where only some members use GSD, or when company policy requires a clean repository.

## Self-Healing

GSD includes automatic recovery for common git issues:

- **Detached HEAD** — merge and worktree flows now refuse to proceed from a detached project root instead of silently switching branches. Check out the intended integration branch, then resume.
- **Stale lock files** — removes `.git/index.lock` only after it is older than 5 minutes, so active git operations on large repos are not interrupted.
- **Interrupted git operations** — recovery can abort leftover rebase, cherry-pick, or revert state from a killed worker before reconciling merge state.
- **Unsafe branch resets** — worktree and branch-mode setup refuses to force-reset a milestone branch if doing so would orphan commits that are not reachable from the start point.
- **Orphaned worktrees** — detects and offers to clean up abandoned worktrees (worktree mode only)

Run `/gsd doctor` to check git health manually.

## Native Git Operations

Since v2.16, GSD uses libgit2 via native bindings for read-heavy operations in the dispatch hot path. This eliminates ~70 process spawns per dispatch cycle, improving auto-mode throughput.
