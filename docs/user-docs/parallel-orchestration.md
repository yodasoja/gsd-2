# Parallel Milestone Orchestration

Run multiple milestones simultaneously in isolated git worktrees. Each milestone gets its own worker process, its own branch, and its own context window, while a coordinator tracks progress, enforces budgets, and keeps everything in sync through the shared project-root SQLite runtime.

> **Status:** Behind `parallel.enabled: false` by default. Opt-in only — zero impact to existing users.
>
> **Single-host only:** Parallel workers must run on the same machine against a local project checkout. The coordination layer depends on SQLite WAL semantics on local disk and is not supported across machines or network-mounted filesystems.

## Quick Start

1. Enable parallel mode in your preferences:

```yaml
---
parallel:
  enabled: true
  max_workers: 2
---
```

2. Start parallel execution:

```
/gsd parallel start
```

GSD scans your milestones, checks dependencies and file overlap, shows an eligibility report, and spawns workers for eligible milestones.

3. Monitor progress:

```
/gsd parallel status
```

4. Stop when done:

```
/gsd parallel stop
```

## How It Works

```

### Worker Isolation

Each worker is a separate `gsd` process with complete isolation:

| Resource | Isolation Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Filesystem** | Git worktree — each worker has its own checkout |
| **Git branch** | `milestone/<MID>` — one branch per milestone |
| **State derivation** | `GSD_MILESTONE_LOCK` env var — `deriveState()` only sees the assigned milestone |
| **Context window** | Separate process — each worker has its own agent sessions |
| **Metrics** | Project-root `.gsd/metrics.json` remains the durable ledger; worktree diagnostics may be mirrored back there |
| **Crash recovery** | Coordination state stays anchored at the project root; per-worker locks and diagnostics are implementation details, not the source of truth |

### Coordination

Workers and the coordinator coordinate through the project-root SQLite database in WAL mode:

- **Worker registry** (`workers`) — heartbeats and liveness are written centrally
- **Milestone leases** (`milestone_leases`) — only one worker may own a milestone at a time
- **Dispatch ledger** (`unit_dispatches`) — duplicate unit claims are rejected atomically
- **Cancellation + command queue** (`cancellation_requests`, `command_queue`) — pause/stop/resume handoff is persisted in shared runtime state

This model assumes local-disk locking semantics. Do not place the project on NFS/SMB/FUSE-style mounts or try to share `.gsd/gsd.db*` across hosts.

## Eligibility Analysis

Before starting parallel execution, GSD checks which milestones can safely run concurrently.

### Rules

1. **Not complete** — Finished milestones are skipped
2. **Dependencies satisfied** — All `dependsOn` entries must have status `complete`
3. **File overlap check** — Milestones touching the same files get a warning (but are still eligible)

### Example Report

```
# Parallel Eligibility Report

## Eligible for Parallel Execution (2)

- **M002** — Auth System
  All dependencies satisfied.
- **M003** — Dashboard UI
  All dependencies satisfied.

## Ineligible (2)

- **M001** — Core Types
  Already complete.
- **M004** — API Integration
  Blocked by incomplete dependencies: M002.

## File Overlap Warnings (1)

- **M002** <-> **M003** — 2 shared file(s):
  - `src/types.ts`
  - `src/middleware.ts`
```

File overlaps are warnings, not blockers. Both milestones work in separate worktrees, so they won't interfere at the filesystem level. Conflicts are still possible at merge time, and the coordination guarantees only apply when all workers share the same local SQLite/WAL runtime on one host.

## Configuration

Add to `~/.gsd/PREFERENCES.md` or `.gsd/PREFERENCES.md`:

```yaml
---
parallel:
  enabled: false            # Master toggle (default: false)
  max_workers: 2            # Concurrent workers (1-4, default: 2)
  budget_ceiling: 50.00     # Aggregate cost limit in dollars (optional)
  merge_strategy: "per-milestone"  # When to merge: "per-slice" or "per-milestone"
  auto_merge: "confirm"            # "auto", "confirm", or "manual"
---
```

### Configuration Reference

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master toggle. Must be `true` for `/gsd parallel` commands to work. |
| `max_workers` | number (1-4) | `2` | Maximum concurrent worker processes. Higher values use more memory and API budget. |
| `budget_ceiling` | number | none | Aggregate cost ceiling in USD across all workers. When reached, no new units are dispatched. |
| `merge_strategy` | `"per-slice"` or `"per-milestone"` | `"per-milestone"` | When worktree changes merge back to main. Per-milestone waits for the full milestone to complete. |
| `auto_merge` | `"auto"`, `"confirm"`, `"manual"` | `"confirm"` | How merge-back is handled. `confirm` prompts before merging. `manual` requires explicit `/gsd parallel merge`. |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd parallel start` | Analyze eligibility, confirm, and start workers |
| `/gsd parallel status` | Show all workers with state, units completed, and cost |
| `/gsd parallel stop` | Stop all workers (enqueues stop + sends SIGTERM) |
| `/gsd parallel stop M002` | Stop a specific milestone's worker |
| `/gsd parallel pause` | Pause all workers (finish current unit, then wait) |
| `/gsd parallel pause M002` | Pause a specific worker |
| `/gsd parallel resume` | Resume all paused workers |
| `/gsd parallel resume M002` | Resume a specific worker |
| `/gsd parallel merge` | Merge all completed milestones back to main |
| `/gsd parallel merge M002` | Merge a specific milestone back to main |

## Command Lifecycle

The coordinator communicates with workers through persisted runtime commands:

```
Coordinator                    Worker
    │                            │
    ├── enqueue("pause") ─────→  │
    │                            ├── claimNextCommand()
    │                            ├── pauseAuto()
    │                            │   (finish current unit, wait)
    │                            │
    ├── enqueue("resume") ────→  │
    │                            ├── claimNextCommand()
    │                            ├── resume dispatch loop
    │                            │
    ├── enqueue("stop") ──────→  │
    │   + SIGTERM ────────────→  │
    │                            ├── claimNextCommand() or SIGTERM handler
    │                            ├── stopAuto()
    │                            └── process exits
```

Workers poll the shared command queue between units. The coordinator also sends `SIGTERM` for immediate response on stop.

## Merge Reconciliation

When milestones complete, their worktree changes need to merge back to main.

### Merge Order

- **Sequential** (default): Milestones merge in ID order (M001 before M002)
- **By-completion**: Milestones merge in the order they finish

### Conflict Handling

1. Runtime coordination state (worker registry, leases, dispatches, cancellation requests, command queue) lives in the project-root SQLite runtime and is not merge-driven.
2. Code conflicts — **stop and report**. The merge halts, showing which files conflict. Resolve manually and retry with `/gsd parallel merge <MID>`.

### Example

```
/gsd parallel merge

# Merge Results

- **M002** — merged successfully (pushed)
- **M003** — CONFLICT (2 file(s)):
  - `src/types.ts`
  - `src/middleware.ts`
  Resolve conflicts manually and run `/gsd parallel merge M003` to retry.
```

## Budget Management

When `budget_ceiling` is set, the coordinator tracks aggregate cost across all workers:

- Cost is summed from each worker's session status
- When the ceiling is reached, the coordinator enqueues stop commands for workers
- Each worker also respects the project-level `budget_ceiling` preference independently

## Health Monitoring

### Doctor Integration

`/gsd doctor` detects parallel session issues:

- **Stale parallel sessions** — Worker process died without cleanup. Doctor inspects the shared runtime DB for expired heartbeats, crashed workers, and stale coordination rows, then reconciles them.

Run `/gsd doctor --fix` to clean up automatically.

### Stale Detection

Sessions are considered stale when:
- The worker PID is no longer running (checked via `process.kill(pid, 0)`)
- The last heartbeat is older than 30 seconds

The coordinator runs stale detection during `refreshWorkerStatuses()` and automatically removes dead sessions.

## Safety Model

| Safety Layer | Protection |
|-------------|------------|
| **Feature flag** | `parallel.enabled: false` by default — existing users unaffected |
| **Eligibility analysis** | Dependency and file overlap checks before starting |
| **Worker isolation** | Separate processes, worktrees, branches, context windows |
| **`GSD_MILESTONE_LOCK`** | Each worker only sees its milestone in state derivation |
| **`GSD_PARALLEL_WORKER`** | Workers cannot spawn nested parallel sessions |
| **Budget ceiling** | Aggregate cost enforcement across all workers |
| **Command-based shutdown** | Graceful stop via persisted DB commands + SIGTERM |
| **Doctor integration** | Detects and cleans up orphaned sessions |
| **Conflict-aware merge** | Stops on code conflicts while runtime coordination state stays anchored in the shared DB |

## File Layout

```
.gsd/
├── gsd.db                       # Shared runtime DB (workers, leases, dispatches, commands, runtime_kv)
├── gsd.db-wal                   # WAL sidecar for the shared runtime DB
├── gsd.db-shm                   # Shared-memory sidecar for the WAL runtime
├── worktrees/                   # Git worktrees (one per milestone)
│   ├── M002/                    # M002's isolated checkout
│   │   └── src/                 # M002's working copy
│   └── M003/
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

`gsd.db*` and `.gsd/worktrees/` are runtime artifacts and should be gitignored.

## Troubleshooting

### "Parallel mode is not enabled"

Set `parallel.enabled: true` in your preferences file.

### "No milestones are eligible for parallel execution"

All milestones are either complete or blocked by dependencies. Check `/gsd queue` to see milestone status and dependency chains.

### Worker crashed — how to recover

Workers now persist coordination state in the shared runtime DB. If a worker process dies, the coordinator detects heartbeat expiry, marks the worker as crashed, and releases stale coordination state so a replacement worker can resume safely.

1. Run `/gsd doctor --fix` to clean up stale sessions
2. Run `/gsd parallel status` to see current state
3. Re-run `/gsd parallel start` to spawn new workers for remaining milestones

### Merge conflicts after parallel completion

1. Run `/gsd parallel merge` to see which milestones have conflicts
2. Resolve conflicts in the worktree at `.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/`
3. Retry with `/gsd parallel merge <MID>`

### Workers seem stuck

Check if budget ceiling was reached: `/gsd parallel status` shows per-worker costs. Increase `parallel.budget_ceiling` or remove it to continue.
